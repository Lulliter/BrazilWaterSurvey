Analysis of Survey WSS Operators Brazil


# some hypothesis 

+	p.9 “digital water / smart metering could reduce costs of identifying leakage, but these savings are actually small compared to the cost of fixing the leakages (huge)”!
+	we are trying to assess where operators stand but is it really effective? (should this be priority to push)?
+	p.10 water reuse saving cold be also huge, but adoption will be slow... (except in places with such shortage of fresh water that it would be important) 
+	p.35 urbanization is associated to higher consumption per capita (-) / as well as could reduce unit cost of networks (+) —> hence the effects are mixed

* we have no idea if tariffs are low or high in LAC (people say are too low, but in fact they are not showing in the Database) 

* or maybe it is that metering is not widespread … and there are leakages 


# some questions

> ? is the age at all relevant? (2 efficiency etc? )

> Is the customer mix (more or less residential relevant)? (2 innovation? / reliability)

> Is the "integration" W & S at all relavant (2 innovation? )
