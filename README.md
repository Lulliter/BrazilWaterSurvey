# Brazil WSS Operators Survey 2018/2019


### Description and context: 
This is a static webpage created to track the progress of a survey on Brazil WSS Operators. The survey is part of a larger effort to collect original data in preparation of the publication **"Development in America" 2020** that will focus on Infrastructure. This specific survey is sponsored by the **Interamerican Development Bank (IADB)**, Water Division, Knowledge Team  [WSA Knowledge](https://idbg.sharepoint.com/sites/WSAknowledge), where I work as a consultant. 


### Content: 
This webpage http://brazilwatersurvey.lulliter.com/ has been built as an `R Markdown website`, using `Jekyll` as a static site generator with `GitHub Pages` - actually redirected to my custom domain on `AWS`. 

The code for the page is on my [Github repo](https://github.com/Lulliter/BrazilWaterSurvey), which is actually a sud-directory of the research project. The latter (not publicly disclosed because includes confidential data) is on the IADB company OneDrive cloud.   

### Creators: 
This page was created by Luisa Mimmi (lmm76@georgetown.edu or lmmimmi@iadb.org) but builds on data collected by various IADB colleagues and partner organizations. See [**Info page**](http://brazilwatersurvey.lulliter.com/info.html) for all due credits.
