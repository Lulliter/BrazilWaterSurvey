## Descriptive Statistics of Survey WSS Operators Brazil

In observing the survey outcomes, I will try comparing across potential relevant features:

+ **Ownership/type** and 
+ **Size of covered area** 
+ **Service mix** (W/S/W+S)
+ (possibly **Prevalence of urban vs rural coverage vs**)
+ (**Age**?)
+ (**State**) ? 


Here is a very basic distribution of our sampled Suppliers in Brazil, by STATE (UF), Ownership Type and size of Coverage reach

```{r tblcov, results="asis", warning=FALSE}
load(here::here("output", "tbl_uf_own_cov.Rdata"))
# class(tbl_uf_own_cov)
caption <- "Sampled Suppliers in Brazil, by STATE (UF), Ownership Type and size of Coverage reach"
covtable <- pandoc.table.return(tbl_uf_own_cov, 
										  keep.line.breaks = F, 
                                 style = "multiline", 
 										  justify = "lcrr", 
										  caption = caption
										  )

cat(covtable)
```

##  Legislative Context

1. Overall, it seems that the majority of the Suppliers declare they operate in a context where there is legislation for key operational aspects such as:
	+ Coverage Areas
	+ Service 
	+ Quality
	+ Tariffs

![Plot_CountByLawOwnersh.png](./output/Plot_CountByLawOwnersh.png "Plot_CountByLawOwnersh.png")
</center>


## 1) COVERAGE

### Summary of key coverage numeric variable 

+ The WSS suppliers in the sample - as of `r format(Sys.time(), '%B %e, %Y')` - cover an average of *85 municipios* (almost always in one State), corresponding to a mean *covered population of 2,596,772*. 
+ The suppliers on average serve localities that are *84% urban*. 


```{r tbldescstatcov, results="asis", warning=FALSE}
load(here::here("output", "tbl_descstat_cov.Rdata"))
# class(tbl_descstat_cov)

caption <- "Summary of Coverage variables"
var.summary <- pandoc.table.return(tbl_descstat_cov , 
											  keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
											  round = 2,
											  big.mark = ",",
											  justify = "llrrrrrr", # OKKIO AL # DI COLONNE
											  caption = caption, style = "multiline",
											  split.table = Inf
											  )

cat(var.summary)
```


### Area(s) covered vs. service

> Is there any difference between the Product MIX `Q9a_d_Mix_comb` vs the URB-RUR MIX of the supplier `Q4_UrbRur_Mix`[^1]?

There are no suppliers serving exclusively rural area. No remarkable differences in the Product MIX across the URB / RUR MIX types

<center>
![Plot_CountByProdMix.png](./output/Plot_CountByProdMix.png "Plot_CountByProdMix.png")
</center>

[^1]: Later on, I would like to explore if  _(?) Is the urbanization process (size, local distribution, rate) causing the lack (access, quality, affordability ) to service in the region (controlling for physical assets / hydrological condition, pop #,  etc) ? ??_

> NEXT:... (?) Is the urbanization process (size, local distribution, rate) causing the lack (access, quality, affordability ) to service in the region (controlling for physical assets / hydrological condition, pop #,  etc) ? ??


### Summary of key key service charateristics  

the WSS suppliers in the sample as of `r format(Sys.time(), '%B %e, %Y')`,  ...

```{r tbldescstatcovserv, results="asis", warning=FALSE}
load(here::here("output", "tbl_descstat_covserv.Rdata"))
# class(tbl_descstat_cov)

caption <- "Summary of Service variables"
var.summary <- pandoc.table.return(tbl_descstat_covserv , 
											  keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
											  round = 2,
											  big.mark = ",",
											  justify = "llrrrrrr", # OKKIO AL # DI COLONNE
											  caption = caption, style = "multiline",
											  split.table = Inf
											  )

cat(var.summary)
```



## Zooming in on some interesting SERVICE COVERAGE aspects 


### NRW % levels
> Lit Input: 
Some key determinants of high NRW are: 
1. The cost of implementing counter-measures 
2. A political cost associated with the control of unauthorized consumption in marginalized ares 
3. A cost to those people who benefit from corruption 
4. Technical cost of shortening leakage detection time & improving pressure management (especially when the cost of pumping more raw water is 0 or low) [see @gonzalez-gomez_why_2011, pp. 33-35;  ch. 1].
 


Based on the information collected via the survey, we can estimate NRW as per International Water Associationâ€™s (IWA) definition: NRW is defined as water that is placed into a water distribution system that is not billed to customers. 
Our derived indicator is **`NRWm3_pct`** { = (`Q12b_m3_In_Tot` - `Q13_m3_Fatt_Tot`) / `Q12b_m3_In_Tot` *100 }

>>>>> should add a NRW RECAP TABLE HERE >>>>>>>>>> 

Initial exploration shows that: 

1. On average, the % NWR varies quite dramatically across different ownership types (PUBLIC-owned 32%  <  Other 38% < Private 60% (more dispersed))
2. Mean % NWR is lower for suppliers exclusively serving urban areas (34%) than for suppliers servin mixed-urb-rur (43%) ... but sems quite disperserd.
3. On average, the size of served population, is also a great source of variation in the %NRW - highest found in 500-900k size (58%) and smallest in 10-50k size (7%)

### NRW correlation with "suspected" determinant factors 
Visually explore whether the **% of NRW** shows any type of correlation with some variables that could be relevant: 


1. **`Q27_IndivMeter_Perc`**  --> no stryking connection 

<center>
![Plot_grid_NWR_IndMetBY4.png](./output/Plot_grid_NWR_IndMetBY4.png "Plot_grid_NWR_IndMetBY4.png")
</center>

2.  **`Q40_NetworkYrlyInspected_Perc`**  --> no stryking connection

![Plot_grid_NWR_NetInpsBY4.png](./output/Plot_grid_NWR_NetInpsBY4.png "Plot_grid_NWR_NetInpsBY4.png")
</center>
 

 ---


3. **`Q24_VolLossMech_Has`**  --> most suppliers say "Yes" (have a system to record VOLUME LOSSES)  

<center>
![Plot_BOXNWR_VolLoss.png](./output/Plot_BOXNWR_VolLoss.png "Plot_BOXNWR_VolLoss.png")
</center>


4. **`Q39_LeaksDetection_Analyzed`**  --> most suppliers say "Yes" (have a systematic campaign to detect ruptures and LEAKS) and those cases show a somewhat lower NRW   

<center>
![Plot_BOXNWR_Leaks.png](./output/Plot_BOXNWR_Leaks.png "Plot_BOXNWR_Leaks.png")
</center>

5. **`Q41_ClandConn_Analyzed`**  --> the vast majority suppliers say "Yes" (have a system) and those cases show a significantly lower NRW (for now the NO sub-sample is too small to further analyze)

<center>
![Plot_BOXNWR_Cland.png](./output/Plot_BOXNWR_Cland.png "Plot_BOXNWR_Cland.png")
</center>



>  > NEXT ... Further exploration ..... 
	+ Exist procedim for estimation of vol loss/ (Q24)	  
	*  (?) Is the year of operation anywhere connected with efficiency?  
	*  (?) Is thestack of laws connected with efficiency (Expected inverse relation)?? `Q8a_c_Leg_comb`  `Q8a_LegInst_Cover` `Q8b_LegInst_DirServ` "`Q8c_LegInst_DirQual` `Q8d_LegInst_Tarif`", 
 


### Reliability of the service (Interruptions)
> Lit Input: Performance can improve with: 
1) carefully designed private sector participation in service provision 
2) regulatory agencies that are transparent, accountable, and free of political interference, 
3) strong accountability mechanisms for SOE. [see @andres_uncovering_2013 ].


Y + Reliability = Q4... Q45 interruptions 
X + location 
	+ size 
	+ age? Q6
	+ Quality regulation (q8c)
	+ SWIT penetration ? 
	+ % eng in staff
	+ % IT in staff? 


## 2) SWIT
Use of SSWIT still not widespread for various barriers:

	+ high capital investments
	+ slow cost recovery 
	+ limited technical capacity, particularly for small utilities, 
	+ lack of integration between different technologies



## 3) CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

Y + Index of regulation (Q8a....Q8d) cumulative
	+ 





## 4) FINANCE 
> Lit Input: 
1) under-investment + dilapidated infrastructure --> INEFFICIENCIES [see @arniella_can_2018 ]
2) Energy consumption much of O&M costs [see @lackey_energy_2017] 



## 5) TARIFFS
> IADB (?): we have no idea if tariffs are low or high in LAC (people say are too low, but in fact they are not showing in the Database)
