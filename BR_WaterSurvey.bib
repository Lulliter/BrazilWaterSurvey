  title = {Energy {{Management}} for {{Water Utilities}} in {{Latin America}} and the {{Caribbean}} - {{Exploring Energy Efficiency}} and {{Energy Recovery Potential}} in {{Wastewater Treatment Plants}}},
  abstract = {This study was made possible by the financial contribution of the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and the Water Partnership Program (WPP). ESMAP is a global knowledge and technical assistance program for low- and middle-income countries to increase their know-how and institutional capacity to achieve environmentally sustainable energy solutions for poverty reduction and economic growth. WPP is a global partnership for improved water resources management and water service delivery. The World Bank Group administers both programs.
The study was prepared by the Water Environment \& Reuse Foundation (WE\&RF) under Contract No. 7171721 with the World Bank Group. The research was largely enabled by WE\&RF's partner institutions for this study: La Universidad de los Andes, Colombia, and Natural Systems Utilities, United States and Colombia. Without their dedication to the project through the discussion of ideas, connecting WE\&RF with utilities and experts, and reviewing draft materials, this work would not have been possible. Their local expertise on issues facing Latin American utilities added perspective and depth to the project.
The research team would like to thank the following individuals from the World Bank Group for their time and direction to this project: Carmen Yee-Batista, Jean-Martin Brault, and Lara Chinarro. Thank you to Elvira Broeks and Pamela Duran for their help with logistics and to Inge Pakulski, editor, for her dedication and support in finalizing this report.
The research team also thanks Allison Deines of WE\&RF for her assistance with translation, Lola Olabode of WE\&RF for her early work on the project, and Tsenguun Tumurkhuyag, WE\&RF intern, for her contributions. Thank you to Jaime Alba of DC Water for his review of our work and translations. Special thanks to Nelson Casta{\~n}o and others at the Asociaci{\'o}n Colombiana de Ingenier{\'i}a Sanitaria y Ambiental (ACODAL) for their collaboration on the Regional Workshop that helped inform the research of this project. Thank you to Barry Liner and the Water Environment Federation for their support and review of this project.
Finally, thank you to all the utilities in Latin America and the Caribbean who generously shared their experiences and pointed the research team to various resources and data. Their knowledge helped shape and strengthen this research effort. Special thanks to the water and wastewater utilities who spent additional time serving as case studies for this project. Their participation provided valuable insight for this report and all utilities seeking to achieve energy efficiency and recovery.},
